  <br>
So I began my journey here <br>
When I was in third grade <br>
I learned to ride a unicycle <br>
As well as how to braid <br>
<br>
The next two years they were for me <br>
Comparatively bland <br>
The most exciting thing I did <br>
Was break a music stand <br>
<br>
In sixth grade I remember <br>
A story Ms Pothof read <br>
And something inappropriate <br>
Dakota might have said <br>
<br>
And as for seventh grade <br>
It wasn't that much fun <br>
Apart from playing basketball with <br>
Ben's mom's dad's grandson <br>
<br>
And then as an eighth grader <br>
The caterpillars arrived <br>
To be completely honest <br>
I'm not sure how I survived <br>
<br>
I played a lot of ping-pong <br>
When I was in ninth grade <br>
Won twelve hundred dollars off Zhumabek <br>
Which he still hasn't paid <br>
<br>
My 10th grade year I ended <br>
Abroad in Germany <br>
My experience there was dampered by <br>
Die Korona Pandemie <br>
<br>
11th grade was somber <br>
Until we got off Zoom <br>
I was grateful to be back in person <br>
So were others I assume <br>
<br>
This final year's been quite severe <br>
I've had to ponder my career <br>
Whether to be a black marketeer or <br>
become a civil engineer <br>
<br>
